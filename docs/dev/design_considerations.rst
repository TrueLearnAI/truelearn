Design Considerations
=====================

The following design considerations were made when developing the TrueLearn library:

Contents
--------
- `Target Platform`_
- `Docstring format`_
- `Class Design`_

Target Platform
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The library is designed to be used across multiple platforms, including Windows, Linux, and Mac OS X.

Docstring format
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
We use Google style docstrings for all functions and methods.  See the `Google Style Guide`_ for more information.

Class Design
