Design Considerations
=====================

Target Platform
---------------
The library is designed to be used across multiple platforms, including Windows, Linux, and Mac OS X.


Docstring format
----------------
We use Google style docstrings for all functions and methods. See the `Google Style Guide`_ for more information.

.. _Google Style Guide: https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html#38-comments-and-docstrings

We believe that all the methods and classes in TrueLearn should be documented as we believe this will not only help users but also future developers.
So, before you make a PR, make sure you properly document all methods and classes based on the `Google Style Guide`_.

------------
Mention pep8 and how to add new classifiers i.e. extend base
