TrueLearn welcomes contributions in the form of Pull Requests.

If you need any help, please feel free to create a new discussion. Our team will be happy to help you.


Install TrueLearn from source
-----------------------------
TrueLearn is a Python library that requires Python 3.7+ to run. So, make sure you have the Python 3.7 installed.

After installing Python 3.7 and cloning the repository, install TrueLearn locally from source::

    pip install -e .[dev]

If you are using zsh, you may need to run::

    pip install -e ".[dev]"

Using ``pip install -e`` will install TrueLearn in editable mode, which means that when you make any changes to the source code,
the version you install will be updated accordingly, without the need to reinstall.

Now, you are ready to explore the next section.
