Getting Started
===============

It is highly recommended to use a `virtual environment (venv)`_ to install and run Truelearn.
This will ensure that the dependencies of Truelearn do not conflict with other
packages installed on your system.

Some IDEs (e.g. PyCharm) have built-in support for virtual environments.

Installation
------------

First install the 64-bit version of Python 3.7 or later from https://www.python.org/downloads/.

Then, create a virtual environment and activate it:

``python -m venv truelearn-venv # create a virtual environment named truelearn-venv``

``truelearn-venv\Scripts\activate # activate the virtual environment``

Finally, install Truelearn using pip:

``pip install truelearn # install truelearn``

Remember to activate the virtual environment every time you want to use Truelearn.
