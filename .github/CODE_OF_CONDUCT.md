# Code of Conduct

We are committed to creating a friendly and respectful place for having discussions, asking questions, and sharing ideas.
Decisions are made by consensus and technical merit.

Any contributions big or small are welcomed and appreciated. 
Reviewing code, improving documentation, and submitting bug reports are all great ways to do this.

We abide by the Python Software Foundation Code of Conduct which can be found at https://www.python.org/psf/conduct/.
