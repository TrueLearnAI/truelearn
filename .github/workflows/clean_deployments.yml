  # To share the secrets between jobs for our Python Publish Action, we need to use
  # an environment which creates multiple deployments.
  # This action cleans up the GitHub PR when the deployments are
  # no longer needed.
  # Due to API limitations, we cant call this action from the Python Publish Action,
  # so we need to call this on each PR.
